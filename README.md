# image-ml
This is a project where i want to recognise images using ML

We can do this with tensorflow, but i think that it should be more brainy

After a long time trying to open .gif without being succeded, i used sips:
sips -s format jpeg images/*.gif --out jpges
and it worked


For execute predict_images.py you could use 0 or 1 parameter, by default it will predict apple-15, but you can pass through the parameter the complete path of the image you want to predict(you have to execute it in the same path of apple-15)
